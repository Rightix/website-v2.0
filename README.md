# website-v2.0

Hello, everybody!
In this project we will develop a new version of the site for our company. 
Layouts are already available and you can request them from Timofey. 

On the agenda... 
1) unique landings with agreed design;
2) adaptive version of the site (we estimate how to stretch elements, etc.), and also we focus on design for mobile versions.
3) Timofey suggested a "mobile first" approach - we should try it.
4) Finishing with the layout, we introduce a change of language for the web page, as well as a "dark theme" (OMG!)
